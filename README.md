# Product-Backorder
A machine learning experiment on Azure to predict product backorder using predictions for demand and history of demand/supply. This algorithm is able to predict product backorder scenario with about 92.7% accuracy when most other algorithms are able to predict up to 90.6% of accuracy level.

Additional level of accuracy is important for critical products including high value or critical items for manufacturing and to predict potential of life saving drug backorder scenario. The self learning algorithm readjusts itself based on its outcome and the accuracy level improves over time.
